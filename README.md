## Results: 

The results of this project allow users to sort by a feature: date, city, state, country and shape. For example, they could look up all of the UFO sitings on 1/2/2020, and find out there there were 2 sightings that day. 

### Date
The user enters the desired date, the change is detected and the table is updated accordingly.


### City
The user enters the desired city, the change is detected and the table is updated accordingly.


### State
The user enters the desired country, the change is detected and the table is updated accordingly.


### Country and Shape
The user enters the desired state and shape observed, the changes are detected and the table is updated accordingly.


## Summary: 
### Drawbacks

- A drawback to this site is there is no where to clear the search once you have selected one of the parameters.
- Another drawback is that you are unable to select a specific parameter, you have to go through the whole list of results to find the one you are looking. 

### Future Design

- A way to fix these would to be to include a reset button and then also to seledct a drop-down list to inlcude all filter values for the user to select.
